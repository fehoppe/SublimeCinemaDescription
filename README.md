# SublimeCinemaDescription
Syntax definition for .res and .str files used by Cinema 4D's description resources. This definition can also be used for dialog resources, but has not been designed for it. There will also be some missing flags and types for resource files, due to the format being rather extensive. This mostly serves as good enough ;)

It will look something like this (color scheme not included):

![A resource file using the syntax definition](img/pyro_res.png "A resource file using the syntax definition")
![A string file using the syntax definition](img/pyro_str.png "A string file using the syntax definition")
